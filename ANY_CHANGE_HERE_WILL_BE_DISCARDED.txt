This folder is made to be synced with the github: https://github.com/autolab-project/autolab-drivers

Any change that is made here will be overwritten at next:
autolab.install_drivers()

For this very reason we advice the user not to modify the content of this folder and its sub-folders.

Local drivers may be written in the dedicated folder at %userprofile%/autolab/drivers/local

For more infos see: https://autolab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
